# Singularity definition file to build container.
# With tensorflow and friends.
#
# This bootstraps the official tensorflow Docker image
# and installs dependencies.
#
# To build the singularity image, save this file as "Singularity.def"
# (but the name is totally arbitrary). Then build...
# 
#    sudo apptainer build IMAGE_NAME.sif Singularity.def

Bootstrap: docker
From: tensorflow/tensorflow:2.9.1-gpu-jupyter
